# Real-time updates

Squid instantly reflects updates in the UI before server confirmation. This ensures every client sees consistent,
real-time data.

To see the real-time capabilities of the SDK, open two browser tabs with this sample and try to:

- Buy or sell stocks
- Run the simulation
- Regenerate your portfolio
