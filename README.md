# Create a stock portfolio app with Squid

Welcome to Squid Cloud! This project contains a function stock portfolio application, built with Squid, as well as steps next steps to make improvements!

## Prerequisites

For this project you will need:

- NodeJS v18 or later.
- A Squid Cloud account and a Squid application. To sign up for Squid, go to [Squid Cloud Console](https://console.squid.cloud). Once signed up, you can create an application.
- The Squid Cloud CLI (`npm i @squidcloud/cli`).

## Environment configuration

### Setting up your `.env` file

After cloning this project, go to the [Squid Cloud Console](https://console.squid.cloud), create an application (if haven't done so already) and click the **Create .env file** button under **Backend project**. This provides you with the command to create the `.env` file required for this template to work and run.

Change to the backend directory, and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Run the initialization command you copied from the console. The command has the following format:

```bash
squid init-env \
 --appId YOUR_APP_ID \
 --apiKey YOUR_API_KEY \
 --environmentId YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_ID \
 --squidDeveloperId YOUR_SQUID_DEVELOPER_ID \
 --region YOUR_REGION
```

### Setting up the frontend

Finish setting up the frontend by navigating to the `frontend` dir and running the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run setup-env
```


## Running the application

To launch both the frontend and local backend servers of your Squid application, run the following command from the root directory:

```bash
npm run start
```

You'll see output similar to the following, indicating that your server is up and running:

```bash
> nodemon --watch ./src --exec ts-node -r tsconfig-paths/register src/main.ts
[Nest] 68047  - 03/15/2024, 7:55:23 PM     LOG [NestApplication] Nest application successfully started +1ms
```

as well as the following for the frontend:

```bash
  VITE v5.1.6  ready in 149 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h + enter to show help
